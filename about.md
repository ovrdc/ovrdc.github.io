##<a href="www.ovrdc.org" target="_blank">Ohio Valley Regional Development Commission</a>
The Ohio Valley Regional Development Commission is a public regional planning commission established by agreement among its members pursuant to Section 713.21 of the Ohio Revised Code, as amended.

##GitHub Maps
We use GitHub's simple web hosting to easily test out our javascript maps. Since we use many open source tools in our maps, we decided to publish this site to share various examples of leaflet.js, google maps api and other data visualizations tools.

This site just shows examples of code and techniques, which are not always the best as there are many ways to go about things in javascript. Our production maps will soon be on our <a href="http://www.ovrdc.org/maps">Map Gallery</a>.

## About this Jekyll Theme
This site is built with Jekyll on Github. It is a clone of the Emerald Theme. Here is the About section from the theme website.

Emerald is a minimal theme created for Jekyll. The main purpose of Emerald is to provide a clear theme for those who want a blog ready to use, focused on the content and mobile-first.

For further details on Emerald, please visit the [repository on Github](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/).

### Setup
Emerald may be installed by simply downloading the .zip folder from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/archive/master.zip).

After extracting the content from the folder into the selected directory, you can type ``jekyll serve`` from the terminal, than open your browser to ``0.0.0.0:4000/emerald/`` and you will find it there.

Additionally it is possible to fork the repository and use Github Pages as hosting. By following this way it will be enough to change the ``baseurl`` value into the ``_config.yml`` file, with the directory name of your project (for example /blog) or simply with a "/" (slash) if you want install Emerald in the root. 

Last but not least: the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) is the best starting point!

Enjoy!
