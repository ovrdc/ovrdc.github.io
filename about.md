##GitHub Maps
We use GitHub's simple web hosting to easily test out our javascript maps. Since we use many open source tools in our maps, we decided to publish this site to share various examples of leaflet.js, google maps api and other data visualizations tools.

This site just shows examples of code and techniques, which are not always the best as there are many ways to go about things in javascript. Our production maps can be viewed at our <a href="http://www.ovrdc.org/maps">Map Gallery</a>.
